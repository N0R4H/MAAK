## 🚨 The Crisis We're Solving

During the devastating 2023 Morocco earthquake, **thousands of families in remote Atlas Mountain villages were never located and never received aid**. They had:

- ❌ No digital footprint or formal addresses  
- ❌ No internet or phone connectivity to call for help  
- ❌ No way for aid organizations to find them  

While some areas received multiple deliveries, **entire communities were completely forgotten**.

## 💡 Our Solution: معاك

**معاك** (pronounced *Ma'ak*, meaning *with you* in Arabic) is an AI-powered emergency aid platform ensuring **every affected family** is located, tagged, and supported—especially the unreachable and undocumented.

> *"In humanity's darkest hours, no one is left behind, forgotten, or invisible."*
